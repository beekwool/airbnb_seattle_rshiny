# Airbnb Seattle Listings R Shiny App
> Finding insights in Seattle on Airbnb.com

## Project Goal
This Shiny app aims to provide Arbnb hosts in Seattle profitibility insights and a tool to discover how their listings compare to similar listings in Seattle.

## Data in Scope
* Listings with a review at least within six months of data gathering
* Date range is June, 2020 - November, 2020

## Note on listing profit:
1. Arbnb doesn not differenciate date booked by customers or date blocked out by hosts, therefore the profit listed here would be an over estimation of actual gains by hosts.
2. Maximum occupency is capped at 70%, the cap is reached, profit is adjusted down by 30% as a rough adjustment to accomodate the overestimation
